======================================

LLM
---
• GPT-4o-mini: Conversational AI for answering questions about dementia guidelines
• GPT-4o Vision: Analyzes home images and provides design recommendations
• Processes natural language queries and generates evidence-based responses
• Extracts medical entities and relationships from documents
• Cost-effective and fast for real-time interactions


EMBEDDING
---------
• text-embedding-3-large (OpenAI)
• Converts document chunks into 3072-dimensional vectors
• Enables semantic similarity search across dementia guidelines
• High accuracy for context-relevant retrieval
• Creates searchable vector representations of PDF documents


RETRIEVAL
---------
• Hybrid RAG: Vector Store (ChromaDB) + Knowledge Graph (NetworkX)
• ChromaDB: Semantic search with persistent SQLite storage
• Knowledge Graph: Entity relationships using spaCy NER
• Combines both approaches for comprehensive context retrieval
• Returns top-k relevant chunks enhanced with graph relationships
• Stored locally in ./chroma_db/ for fast, persistent access
