**ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**

**Item:** Floor tiles
- **Category:** Contrast
- **Issue:** The light-colored floor tiles do not provide sufficient contrast with the walls and furniture, making it difficult for someone with dementia to distinguish boundaries.
- **Guideline Reference:** "Use colour and tonal contrast to distinguish one surface from another, or to make certain objects stand out against their background."
- **Recommendation:** Replace floor tiles with medium-toned tiles (LRV 40) to provide contrast with walls and furniture.
- **Explanation:** This creates a clear visual boundary, aiding navigation and reducing fall risk for individuals with dementia.

**Item:** Lighting fixtures
- **Category:** Lighting
- **Issue:** The room lacks adequate lighting, with potential shadows and uneven light distribution.
- **Guideline Reference:** "Provide an environment that is easy to interpret, with good signage and multiple cues to help the person with dementia find their way around their home."
- **Recommendation:** Install LED ceiling lights providing 500 lux at 3000K color temperature for even lighting.
- **Explanation:** Adequate lighting reduces shadows and confusion, supporting safe navigation and orientation.

**Item:** Clutter
- **Category:** Spatial Design
- **Issue:** Excessive clutter obstructs pathways and creates a confusing environment.
- **Guideline Reference:** "Clear pathways and circulation... support a personalised environment that promotes the person’s individuality and where they can feel at home."
- **Recommendation:** Remove excess items and organize remaining belongings to create clear pathways.
- **Explanation:** Reducing clutter enhances safety and ease of movement, supporting independence and reducing anxiety.

**Item:** Storage units
- **Category:** Wayfinding
- **Issue:** The storage units are not clearly labeled, making it difficult to identify their contents.
- **Guideline Reference:** "Provide good visual access to key areas or to important objects to remind and prompt the person with dementia when required."
- **Recommendation:** Label storage units with large, clear text and pictograms.
- **Explanation:** Clear labeling aids memory and orientation, helping individuals with dementia locate items independently.

**Item:** Wall paint
- **Category:** Color
- **Issue:** The white walls lack contrast with the ceiling and floor, making it difficult to distinguish boundaries.
- **Guideline Reference:** "Paint skirting boards and door frames a contrasting colour to walls and ceilings to ensure a clear contrast is made between."
- **Recommendation:** Repaint walls in soft pastel blue (LRV 65) with matte finish.
- **Explanation:** This provides a calming environment with sufficient contrast to aid in navigation and reduce confusion.
